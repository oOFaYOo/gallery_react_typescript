# gallery_react_typescript

The one-page site is a gallery. The site has the ability to add pictures. And the site has the ability to delete pictures.
To delete an image, you must open the image in full size and click "delete". To add an image, it is necessary that the name of the image does not contain Russian letters.

Tested only on Google Chrome.

Second experience of using React and TypeScript.
